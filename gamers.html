            Clark is the newest member of the average gaming firm.  He's not too good yet at shooting but poops a mean diaper.

            James is the father of Clark.  He is the best gamer on the team hands-down and has the highest k/d ever.  You can see him carrying Clark in real life and Andrew always in apex.

            Andrew is from Canada.  He is the epitome of average here at the average gaming firm.  If you play 20 games with him, he will have 1 where he gets over 2k damage and 7 kills, and then will struggle for 100 damage the rest of the night.

            Trevor stinks and is gross.  He used to be really good on console but is now lower than average.  He has to play with console even on pc and couldn't hit the broadside of a barn.  And he always streams in his underpants.
